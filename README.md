## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Learned to use picture element when using several images. I have now coded mobile-first approach as my first try, and I will be learning about how to do it as best practice.
### Continued development
Still not quite figured out about grid and flex, so grid, flex and mobile-first is what I will continue learning. 
And of course different ways to center stuff on a webpage.
